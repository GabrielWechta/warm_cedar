dd - disk destroyer :)
if - input file 
sda - master hard-disk
bs - read bs BYTES, sector is typicly 512 bytes
count - do it count times
hexdump - filter to good format
-C - HEX+ASCII style filter

memory - watch -n 0 cat meminfo
cpu - watch -n 0 cat cpuinfo
partitions - cat partitions 

loop or lofi (loop fille interface) - makes file accesible as block device

i have sda (sda1 1TB HDD) and sdb (with couple logical partitions SSD)
