       "The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1,  the  init  process,
       are  those  for  which  init  has explicitly installed signal handlers.
       This is done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.

       POSIX.1 requires that kill(-1,sig) send sig to all processes  that  the
       calling process may send signals to, except possibly for some implemen‚Äê
       tation-defined system processes.  Linux  allows  a  process  to  signal
       itself,  but on Linux the call kill(-1,sig) does not signal the calling
       process."
