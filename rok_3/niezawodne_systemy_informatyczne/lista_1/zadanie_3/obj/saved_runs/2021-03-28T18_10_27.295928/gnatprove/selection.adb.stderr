selection.adb:13:35: medium: loop invariant might fail in first iteration, cannot prove Min >= J (e.g. when J = 1 and Min = 0)[#1]
selection.ads:15:16: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Sorted (A) (e.g. when A = (1 => 0, others => 1) and A'First = 0 and A'Last = 1) [possible explanation: loop invariant at selection.adb:21 should mention A][#2]
