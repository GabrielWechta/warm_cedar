        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This page is for showing a little bit of appreciation for math. The first part is report of my private side
            project
            during second semester. While the second part is a Flutter application.</p>
        <h1>Invertible elements in rings of integers expanded by squares of natural numbers.</h1>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The reversible element of a ring $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$ is called the element $\exists b \in \mathbb{R}$
            that satisfies: $a \cdot b=b \cdot a=a$. The
            invertible elements in the ring of integers are of course only $\{-1,1\}$. Algebraic structures can be
            extended
            with elements that do not belong to their sets, just as we do with extending real numbers into composite
            numbers using the imaginary unit $i$. Then our complex number is of the form $a + bi$ where $a,b \in
            \mathbb{R}$ , $(\mathbb{R}(i))$. We
            do the same with integer expansions. Here we will consider expansions of the squares of the natural numbers,
            $\mathbb{Z}(n)$, which have the form $a + bn$.</p>

        <h4>Searching for reversible elements</h4>
        <p>The inverse element of the form $a + b\sqrt{n}$ will have the form $(a + b\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ which we will
            denote by $\frac{1}{a + b\sqrt{n}}$. By side by side
            multiplication we obtain another form of the inverse element
            $$\frac{a - b\sqrt{n}}{a^2 - n \cdot b^2} = \frac{a}{a^2 - n \cdot b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2 - n \cdot b^2}
            \cdot \sqrt{n}.$$
            Hence we see that for the inverse element to be in the ring the following must occur: $\frac{a}{a^2 - n
            \cdot b^2}$ ,
            $\frac{b}{a^2 - n \cdot b^2} \in \mathbb{Z}$. So what integers have the property that:
            $$(1) \; (a^2 - n \cdot b^2 | a) \land (a^2 - n \cdot b^2 | b)?$$

            Note the special case in which:
            $$(2) \; a^2 - n \cdot b^2 \in \{-1, 1\},$$

            then of course regardless of $a$ and $b$ the fraction is integer.

            Note: It is not difficult to see that the numbers $a$ and $b$ will occur in fours: $(a,b)$, $(-a,b)$,
            $(a,-b)$,
            $(-a,-b)$. Instead, we will focus on pairs with both positive numbers.

            Note: Expanding by squares $$4, 9, 16, 25 \, ... $$ obviously gives the original ring $(\mathbb{Z}, +,
            \cdot)$. </p>

        <h4>Numerical Analysis</h4>
        <p>I wrote the algorithm that found out that in $[0, 10^6]$ all the numbers satisfying $(1)$ are satysfing "less
            likely" $(2)$.<br>
            Some examples for $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{2})$:
            $$a = 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, 239, 577, 1393, 3363, 8119$$
            $$b = 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741$$

        </p>

        <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
        <p>
            <b>The invertible elements of a ring of integers extended by a natural root are coefficients at recursively
                determined Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.
            </b>
        </p>

        <h4>Chebyshev polynomials</h4>
        <p>Chebyshev polynomials are a system of orthogonal polynomials that form the basis of a polynomial space. The
            first order Chebyshev polynomials are given by the formula:
            $$T_0(x) = 1, \; T_1(x) = x,$$
            $$T_n(x) = 2 \cdot x T_{n-1}(x) - T_{n-2}(x).$$
            with a generating function:
            $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} T_{n}(x) \frac{t^{n}}{n
            !}=\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{t\left(x-\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\right)}+e^{t\left(x+\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\right)}\right)=e^{t x}
            \cosh \left(t \sqrt{x^{2}-1}\right) .$$
