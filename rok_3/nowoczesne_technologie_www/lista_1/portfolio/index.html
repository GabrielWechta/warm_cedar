    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h4>Birth</h4>
    <p>I was born on Halloween eve in 1999 in Zielona Góra, Poland. After that, I am curiously happy when spooky
        staff happen.
        Furthermore, as everybody born around that time in Poland, I am used to getting presents around first of
        November,
        in Poland first of November is holiday, during which everybody gathers to go visit family graves.
        <br>So graveyards are also my happy places.

    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>For the first 6 years of my life, I lived in Zielona Góra, then we moved to Jelenia Góra. Despite
        similarity in names, places are pretty far from each other.
        When I graduated Primary School, we moved again to Wrocław, which I am eternaly gratefoull for. There I
        began junior high school, I was in architecture oriented class with extended math and art. Both bizzare and
        wonderful.
        When it comes to high school I went to Akademickie Liceum Ogólnokształcące Politechniki Wrocławskiej, which
        is school directly under/conected to Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
        Great time, as a high school student I had plenty opurunites to use University assets, both in form of
        equipment and lecturers. Some of my teachers were high school teacher, some were academic, so while solid
        fundaments were made for matura exam, I also get pretty good preperation for completly diffrent approach and
        style of studing on university. The school understood this potential, and exerted it. For example my math
        class was being taught by two teachers, one was prepering us for standard exam evaluation, when the other's
        classes had more lecture flow.
        <br>Despite, what you might expect about polytechnic high school, surprisingly afford was put into teaching
        us decent humanities. At first with some difficultie, after with tremendous respect my science orietned
        brain started to apprciate art, literature and philosophy.
        <br>Now I am studying on Department of Fundamentals of Computer Science, on Wrocław University of Science and
        Technology (in this case "fundamentals" is not synonym of "basics"). </p>
