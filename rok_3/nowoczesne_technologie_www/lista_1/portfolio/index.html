    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h4>Birth</h4>
    <p>I was born on Halloween eve in 1999 in Zielona Góra, Poland. After that, I am curiously happy when spooky stuff
        happens.
        Furthermore, as everybody born around that time in Poland, I am used to getting presents around the first of
        November,
        in Poland, the first of November is a holiday, during which everybody gathers to go visit family graves.
        <br>So graveyards are my happy places.

    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>For the first 6 years of my life, I lived in Zielona Góra, then we moved to Jelenia Góra. Despite the similarity
        in names, places are pretty far from each other.
        When I graduated Primary School, we moved again to Wrocław, which I am eternally grateful for. There I
        began junior high school, I was in an architecture-oriented class with extended math and art. Both bizarre and
        wonderful.
        When it comes to high school I went to Akademickie Liceum Ogólnokształcące Politechniki Wrocławskiej, which is a
        school directly under/connected to Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
        Great time, as a high school student I had plenty of opportunities to use University assets, both in form of
        equipment and lecturers. Some of my teachers were high school teachers, some were academic, so while solid
        fundaments were made for the matura exam, I also get pretty good preparation for a completely different approach
        and style of studying at university. The school understood this potential and exerted it. For example, my math
        class was being taught by two teachers, one was preparing us for standard exam evaluation when the other's
        classes had more kind of "lecture" flow.
        <br>Despite, what you might expect about polytechnic high school, surprisingly afford was put into teaching us
        decent humanities. At first with some difficulties, after with tremendous respect, my science-oriented
        brain started to appreciate art, literature, and philosophy.
        <br>Now I am studying at the Department of Fundamentals of Computer Science, at Wrocław University of Science
        and
        Technology (in this case "fundamentals" is not a synonym of "basics"). </p>
