        <h4>Birth</h4>
        <p>I was born on Halloween eve in 1999. After that event I am curiously happy when spooky staff happen.
            Furthermore, as everybody born around that time in Poland, I am used to getting presents around first of
            November,
            in Poland first of November is holiday, during which everybody gathers to go visit family graves.
            <br>So graveyards are also my happy places.
            <br>Despite that my other happy places are Hyrule, Lordran, Arkham, Northern Kingdoms and Twin Peaks.</p>

        <h4>Games</h4>
        <p>I know it may be hard to believe, especially because I am an IT engineer, but I love video games. And by love
            I
            mean absolute fascination and deep trust. It really amazes me how they are written, deigned and programmed.
            It is important to notice that video games are subset of games, overall. I really like games like chess and
            role playing games - old, board kind. When I have to much time in my bath I think about how
            really impressing and how absurd is idea of humankind spending time on <i>playing</i>. I am always
            amazed how "bread and
            circuses" turned into "bread and games", <i>homo ludens</i> I suppose. </p>

        <h4>Visual Art</h4>
        <p>My greatest internet discovery where youtube videos about movies, some may call them - video essays.
            Since I have seen video about Quentin Tarantino's techniques to enhance story by camera movement, I
            accidentally found my biggest fascination. Slippery slope after that, when movie is getting "meta" I am
            getting "in love". <br> Next great moment I can point in my movie experience is watching <i>Synecdoche, New
                York</i>. Wow.</p> Also David Lynch is my hero.
