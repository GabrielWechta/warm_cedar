    <h4>IT path</h4>
    <p>As it is the case for most kids, my programming education began with learning C++, around the age of 13. Now it
        seems absurd to me how much one has to know before they can understand their first hello world in that language.
        Despite great effort to learn it pretty well and as soon as possible, my true education began in 3rd great of
        high school, during preparation for the maturity exam.
        <br>What a hard time it was. A lot of duties, never-ending exams and tests, tons of work with no reward. In that
        battlefield mess, however, my love for programming begun to blossom.
        <br>After high school, during my studies, my expectations were happily met by lecturers’ approach and
        professionalism. I learned plenty of languages and frameworks (see below). But what is even more important, I
        understood deep programming ideas and rules.

    <h4>My philosophical rubbish about math</h4>
    <p>At first it may sound like a way too romantic vision of reality but in my opinion, mathematical reasoning is a
        very unnoticed marvel. With every hour spent learning maths and programming (especially logic), I've started to
        notice how everything becomes clearer and more easily understandable. It might be impossible to grasp for people
        who have not spent hundreds of hours considering complex problems and it is still hard to notice for people who
        did, but using mathematical analogies in life boost one's senses significantly. Since I began my studies, I've
        started to notice how many folks make logical mistakes and even empty logical holes in their statements. I have
        always been amazed by how much mathematical reasoning was present in everyday life. In the end, politicians are
        just as unbearable as most nutritionists and "scientists" who do not understand that an experiment's result is
        not a proof on its own.
