    <h4>IT experience</h4>
    <p>As most of Polish kids my programing education began with learning C++, around age of 13. Now it seems absurd how
        much you have to
        know before you can understand you first hello world in that language. Despite great effort to learn it pretty
        well, before high school, my true education began in 3rd great, during preparation for matura exam.<br>
        Bad time it was. A lot of duties, never ending exams and test, tons of work met with no reward. But in that
        battlefield mess, my love to programing started to blossom. <br>
        After high school I started to study Informatics on Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, my
        expectations were happily met by lectures approach and professionalism.</p>

    <h4> Philosophical rubbish</h4>
    <p>At first it may sound like some too romantic vision of reality, but in my opinion it's very unnoticed marvel.
        With every hour spend on learning math and programing (especially logic), I've started to notice how everything
        becomes clearer and more easily understandable. It's impossible to grasp for people who didn't spend hundred of
        hours thinking about really complex problems and it's hard to notice for people who did, but using math
        analogies in life boost one's wisdom significantly. Since I began studies, I've started to notice how many
        folks,
        make logical mistakes and even completely empty logical holes in there statements. At first I was amazed by how
        many mathematical reasoning came to be in everyday life, now it annoys me because group of people I was able to
        listen and to agree with, has decreased as good hip-hop artists after 2015. At the end politicians are
        unbearable same as most nutritionists and "scientist" who do not understand that experiment's result is not
        prove. </p>
