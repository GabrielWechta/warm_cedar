    <h4>Games</h4>
    <p>I know it may be hard to believe, especially because I am an IT engineer, but I love video games. And by love
        I
        mean absolute fascination and deep trust. It really amazes me how they are written, deigned and programmed.
        It is important to notice that video games are subset of games, overall. I really like games like chess and
        role playing games - old, board kind. When I have to much time in my bath I think about how
        really impressing and how absurd is idea of humankind spending time on <i>playing</i>. I am always
        amazed how "bread and
        circuses" turned into "bread and games", <i>homo ludens</i> I suppose. </p>

    <h4>Movies</h4>
    <p>My greatest internet discovery where youtube videos about movies, some may call them - video essays.
        Since I have seen video about Quentin Tarantino's techniques to enhance story by camera movement, I
        accidentally found my biggest fascination. Slippery slope after that. Now I cannot see a movie without analyzing
        how director uses some small details to tell his story better.
        I don't understand why people usually say something like "That's a great movie, Brad Pitt was amazing.". This
        sentence may make an impression that Brad Pitt had some significant impact on the quality of the movie. No,
        Mister, no, no, no. It's like saying that <i>The Night Watch</i> by Rembrandt van Rijn is great because second
        guard on the left is amazing.
        <br>The movie (and his greatness) is mostly director's merit. Movies should be primarily recognizable by
        director, not actors. So how many directories can you mention? Despite hmm... Hitchcock?
        <br>Well, I enjoy knowing them and I usually choose a movie to watch based on director. I really like and
        admire Wes Anderson, Guy Ritchie, Edgar Wright, Joon-ho Bong, Paul Thomas Anderson, David Fincher, Christopher
        Nolan, Peter Jackson (old, of course), Quentin Tarantino, Casey Neistat, Hayao Miyazaki and all those that i
        don't know yet but i will get to know.
        <br>Also <b>David Lynch</b> and <b>Charlie Kaufman</b> are my heroes.

    <h4>Visual Art</h4>
    <p>My greatest internet discovery where youtube videos about movies, some may call them - video essays.
        Since I have seen video about Quentin Tarantino's techniques to enhance story by camera movement, I
        accidentally found my biggest fascination. Slippery slope after that.
        <br> I discovered that art can have many forms and I realised that to understand art one just have to became
        sensitive and not judgemental (is it not, what everybody should be?). At some point I started to make my own,
        like this one underneath.

    <h4>Photography</h4>
    <p>In 2018 during kayaking trip with friends I realised, that none of us was taking pictures. So many great memories
        captured by wind of time and permanently lost. After returning to home I was wondering how to buy cheap camera
        and start taking pictures. Than it dawned me: Analog cameras! Old therefore cheap (how fullish I was) and easy
        to make (how incredibly fullish I was). First roll of my pictures were never to be induced due to absolute no
        knowledge what those crazy buttons and valves are. But it didn't stop me. I learned and experimented. I
        Understood
        how difficult it was to take good photo before digital photography and making whole process automatic.
        <br>Now I have
        4 analog cameras and I appreciate our hard love-hate relationship. All photos you will see underneath are
        analogs (most on the website are too).
