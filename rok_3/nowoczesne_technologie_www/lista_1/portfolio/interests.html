    <h4>Games</h4>
    <p>I know it may be hard to believe, especially because I am an IT engineer, but I love video games. And by love
        I
        mean absolute fascination and deep trust. It amazes me how they are written, designed, and programmed.
        It is important to notice that video games are a subset of games, overall. I like games like chess and
        role-playing
        games - old, board kind. When I have too much time in my bath I think about how incredibly impressing and how
        absurd
        is the idea of humankind spending time on <i>playing</i>. I am always amazed how "bread and circuses" turned
        into
        "bread and games", <i>homo ludens</i> I suppose. </p>

    <h4>Movies</h4>
    <p>My greatest internet discovery were youtube videos about movies, some may call them - video essays.
        Since I have seen a video about Quentin Tarantino's techniques to enhance the story by camera movement, I
        accidentally found my biggest fascination. Slippery slope after that. Now I cannot see a movie without analyzing
        how the director uses some small details to tell his story better.
        I don't understand why people usually say something like "That's a great movie, Brad Pitt was amazing.". This
        sentence may make an impression that Brad Pitt had some significant impact on the quality of the movie. No,
        Mister, no, no, no. It's like saying that <i>The Night Watch</i> by Rembrandt van Rijn is great because the
        second guard on the left is amazing.
        <br>With all love to Brad Pitt, a movie (and its greatness) is mostly the director's merit. In my opinion movies
        should be
        primarily recognizable by the
        director, not actors. And it's very hurtful that many overlooks this fact. So how many directories can you
        mention? Despite hmm... Hitchcock?
        <br>Well, I enjoy knowing them and I usually choose a movie to watch based on the director. I really like and
        admire Wes Anderson, Guy Ritchie, Edgar Wright, Joon-ho Bong, Paul Thomas Anderson, David Fincher, Christopher
        Nolan, Peter Jackson (old, of course), Quentin Tarantino, Casey Neistat, Hayao Miyazaki, and all those that I
        don't know yet but I will get to know.
        <br>Also <b>David Lynch</b> and <b>Charlie Kaufman</b> are my heroes.

    <h4>Visual Art</h4>
    <p>In high school I discovered that art can have many forms and I realized that to understand art one just have to
        become
        sensitive and not judgemental (is it not, what everybody should be?). At some point, I started to make my own
        stuff,
        like this one underneath.

    <h4>Photography</h4>
    <p>In 2018 during a kayaking trip with friends I realized, that none of us was taking pictures. So many great
        memories were captured by the wind of time and permanently lost. After returning home I was wondering how to buy
        a cheap camera and start taking pictures. Then it dawned on me: Analog cameras! Old therefore cheap (how fullish
        I was) and easy to make (how incredibly fullish I was). The first roll of my pictures was never to be induced
        due to absolutely no knowledge of what those crazy buttons and valves are. But it didn't stop me. I learned and
        experimented. I understood
        how difficult it was to take a good photo before digital photography and making the whole process automatic.
        <br>Now I have
        4 analog cameras and I appreciate our hard love-hate relationship. All photos you will see underneath are
        analogs (most on the website are too).
